This directory contains my SAT solver mysolver.py, a CNF-file-generating method CNF_generator.py, an example CNF file random_CNF.txt and a solution for the example CNF file results.txt.
mysolver.py accepts an input file inputfilename.txt in Dimacs format and saves the solution in file outputfilename.txt in format specified in ucilnica. It can be executed by "python mysolver.py 'inputfilename.txt' 'outputfilename.txt'".
CNF_generator.py generates a random file in Dimacs format with specified number of variables and clauses. It generates clauses such that for each clause, the probability of a variable not appearing, appearing normally or appearing negated is 1/3. It takes the number of variables nbvar, the number of clauses nbclauses and a seed for the random number generator. It saves the solution in file outputfilename.txt in Dimacs format. It can be executed by "python CNF_generator.py 'outputfilename.txt' 'nbvar' 'nbclauses' 'seed'".
random_CNF.txt is an example Dimacs file generated by "python CNF_generator.py 'random_CNF.txt' '50' '100000' '42'".
results.txt is the solution to random_CNF.txt as computed by mysolver.py.
